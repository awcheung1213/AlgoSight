/*
Your goal is to obtain k ribbons of the same length, by cutting the ribbons into as many pieces as you want.
Your task is to calculate the maximum integer length L for which it is possible to obtain at least k ribbons of length L by cutting the given ones.
cut but cant add
if num is 9 you can get 2 4s out of it
if num is 7 you can get 1 4 out of it
[5, 2, 7, 4, 9] = 4s from each [1,0,1,1,2] = k if k = 5
For a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 9] and k = 6, the output should be solution(a, k) = 2.

/*
You are given a string s. Your task is to count the number of ways of splitting s into three non-empty parts a, b and c (s = a + b + c) in such a way that a + b, b + c and c + a are all different strings.

NOTE: + refers to string concatenation.

Example

For s = "xzxzx", the output should be solution(s) = 5.
